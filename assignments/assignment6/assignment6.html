            <h2 class="contentHeader">10. Beauty and The Beast</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Beauty and The Beast hits you with great songs centered around their love story. The reason for its low spot is due to sometimes lackluster songs.

            <h2 class="contentHeader">9. The Little Mermaid</h2>
            <p class="content">
                I put this movie on the list out of obligation. Personally, I’m not a huge fan of The Little Mermaid, but it does have a pretty quality soundtrack.

                #Favorite Track: Under the Sea

            <h2 class="contentHeader">8. Moana</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Moana is my pick for a recent Disney movie with a good soundtrack. Coming in with solid songs that will leave you wanting more. Dwayne Johnsons performance as the demi-god is really great.

                #Favorite Track: You're Welcome

            <h2 class="contentHeader">7. The Nightmare Before Christmas</h2>
            <p class="content">
                This movie isn’t often thought of when thinking of the best Disney movies, but it deserves it’s spot in the conversation. It is the greatest Christmas movie of all time and has an amazing soundtrack to boot.

                #Favorite Track: Kidnap Sandy Claws
                <br>
                #Least Favorite Track: Sally's Song

            <h2 class="contentHeader">6. The Princess and The Frog</h2>
            <p class="content">
                This is my sleeper pick of the list. The Princess and the Frog hits you with some many songs that are electrifyingly jazzy. This movie and soundtrack are routinely slept on by the general movie going audience
                <br><br>
                #Favorite Track: Friends on the Other Side
                <br>
                #Least Favorite Track: Ma Belle Evangeline

            <h2 class="contentHeader">5. The jungle book</h2>
            <p class="content">
                The Jungle Book is my personal favorite movie on this list and holds a special place in my heart. The reason it’s not further down is due to the lack of songs in the movie. But, the two songs it does have stay in your head for years after you hear them and are overall just amazing.

            <h2 class="contentHeader">4. The lion king</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Some might see me putting the Lion King at the 4th spot as being a slight to the movie, but the movie is on par with numbers three through one. At this part of the list it really comes down to which of the great compilations of songs I prefer and sadly the Lion King draws the short straw.

            <h2 class="contentHeader">3. Mulan</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Mulan has a top tier soundtrack. That has many memorable songs, the only fault with it is some of the songs are only good, in an album of great songs

                #Favorite Track: A Girl Worth Fighting For

            <h2 class="contentHeader">2. Aladdin</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Aladdin is similar to the number one Item on the list in its consist ability to get songs stuck in your head. Falling short in only the lesser amount of song and the slight bump down in quality.

            <p class="content">
                The number one spot on the list must undoubtably go to Hercules. Hercules is the only soundtrack to be constantly hitting you with memorable songs that stick in your head.
