        <h2>Black Lotus</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">
            Black Lotus is a coveted card in Magic the Gathering. It’s the prized possession of any MTG player that has the pleasure of owning one. But, due to price increases over the past 20 years, the tangibility of owning one has dropped to nearly zero. Due to the reserved list combined with the sheer power of this card, you would be lucky to find an alpha version of this card for under 15,000 dollars.
        </p>

        <h2>Healing Salve</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">
            Healing Salve is on the opposite side of the spectrum to Black Lotus. It is extremely bad. It never sees any play. There have been numerous cards that have been printed that outclass this card. The only reason why the alpha version of this card is expensive is because it’s old.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale & Mishra's Workshop</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 140%;">
            Tabernacle and Mishra's Workshop both follow a similar story to Black Lotus. They are expensive for their limited availability and their sheer power. Mishra’s workshop being so powerful that it is banned in most formats. These cards immense price is almost deserving given their power level, but I don’t think any cardboard is deserving of such a high price tag.

        <h2>The Reserved List</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 162%;text-align:justify;">
            The reserved list was implemented by Wizard’s of the Coast in 1995 after the release of their newest set Chronicles. This shook up the investment side of game, with dozens of cards receiving heavy reprints, plummeting their value. Wizard’s of the Coast made a hasty reaction to quell the worries of investors, by instating the reserved list. Which stated that cards could not be reprinted. In 2002 the reserved list was revised to stop the no reprint policy at the Mercadian Masques expansion.
