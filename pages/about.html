            About This Project
        </h1>
        <p>
            This project is being made by me, Seth Duffy as a part of my web development class.
            I may periodically update this page with changes I make. I was told to share as much information as
            I am comforatable with, so I told you my name. Thanks checking out the site.     
        </p>
        <p>
            Update 1/14/19: Put in about page... formatting of the about and contact pages need large amounts of work. Still fleshing out the formatting on the assignments page.
